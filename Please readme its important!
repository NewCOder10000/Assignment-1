So github web has a 25mb file upload limit but my video walkthrough is 54mb, so i have to compress the video. But this will not affect my politemall submission, video submitted
on politemall will be the full not compressed video. Warning, the quality of the compressed video may not be the best, i am not sure about the quality of the compressed video myself.
